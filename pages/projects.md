###Orion

Orion is a 2D space strategy game with squad based mechanics.  The project was created for an approximately 1 month jam project but was never fully completed.  The game was written using LibGDX and relied heavily on LibGDX-ai for the squad based mechanics.  The game had squad based movement, combat, and resource gathering capabilities.  Procedural generation was used to create the levels and lay out the asteroids used in resource collection.

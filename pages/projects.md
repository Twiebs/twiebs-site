##C++ Site Generator

This project is used to generated the website that you are currently viewing.
It is a small single file library that exposes a data driven C interface for generating HTML.

to generate webpages.  This data driven interface allows html generation based on any arbitrary data source.

###Features
- Standard HTML features
- Markdown parser
- Custom markdown function call syntax
  - Allows application defined functions to be called inside markdown files
- Cpp syntax highlighting

You can check out an example of how this tool is used by taking a look at the source code used for this

##Unnamed Experimental LLVM Language 
(06/2015 - Present)

I have been working on an experimental toy language compiler frontend that targets llvm. I started the project to statisfy my curiosity of the implemtation programming languages.  The syntax and semantics of the language are heavily inspired by Jonathan Blow's JAI, which is a brillant upcoming language attempting to be a replacement for C++ in the games industry.

###Noteable Implemented Features:

- Multi-threaded compilation
- No header files.  Dependices are resolved after the AST has been fully parsed
- Overloadable functions at global scope or locally within a another function

#Very Old Projects

These projects don't really belong here; however, I figured I might as well include them

----

##Orion

Orion is a 2D space strategy game with squad based mechanics.  The project was created for an approximately 1 month jam project but was never fully completed.  The game was written using LibGDX and relied heavily on LibGDX-ai for the squad based mechanics.  The game had squad based movement, combat, and resource gathering capabilities.  Procedural generation was used to create the levels and lay out the asteroids used in resource collection.
